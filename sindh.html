    <h1>About Sindh</h1>
    <p>Sindh was not always called by this name, in fact, it has been given several names over the course of its history. The name ‘Sindh’ derives from ‘Sindhu,’ which is a Sanskrit word used for describing the ocean or water in large quantity. This term was commonly used during the rule of Aryans but as the ancient Persians began to rule this land, they changed the name of the river to ‘Hindu.’
        After the arrival of the Greek Empire, the name of this river was changed to ‘Indos River’. The ‘O’ in the name was replaced by ‘U,’ as it is now called the ‘Indus River’. All of these eras and times have left a lot of clues behind for us to study and find out more about our ancestors. One of the best ways to learn about the past is to visit historical sites. To help you with your ancient discoveries, we have prepared a list of some fascinating historical places in Sindh. So, here we go!

    <p>Moen Jo Daro is an archeological site located in Larkana District in the province of Sindh. It is only 17 kilometres away from the city of Thatta. It comprises many ancient ruins that reveal how people, who lived there thousands of years ago, had adopted architectural trends that were quite modern for that era. In fact, some historians believe Moen Jo Daro was probably the most advanced society of its time. Moen Jo Daro is a phrase of Sindhi language, which means ‘Mound of the dead’. It is an entire city that remained buried underneath the sand for centuries.</p>
